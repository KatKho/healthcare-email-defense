## LLM Prompts Used

### Email Analysis Prompt
```
Healthcare email security analysis with urgency detection. Respond with valid JSON only.

EMAIL DATA:
From: {sender}
To: {userRole} ({recipientInfo.name} - {recipientInfo.role})
Subject: {subject}
Body: {body}
{roleCheck ? `Role Issue: ${roleCheck.reason}` : ''}
{threatIntel ? `Threats: ${threatIntel.threatScore}/100, ${threatIntel.suspiciousLinks} suspicious links` : ''}

REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT:
{
  "classification": "Safe",
  "urgency": "Normal", 
  "confidence": 85,
  "comment": "Brief explanation",
  "reasoningReport": {
    "summary": "2-sentence analysis summary",
    "threatIndicators": ["threat1", "threat2"],
    "roleAnalysis": "Role appropriateness explanation",
    "technicalFindings": ["finding1", "finding2"], 
    "recommendation": "Clear action recommendation",
    "urgencyReason": "Why this email is urgent or normal"
  }
}

CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- Safe: legitimate healthcare communication
- Suspicious: unclear/inappropriate content
- Phishing: malicious intent

URGENCY RULES (CRITICAL - ALWAYS DETECT URGENCY):
- Urgent: medical emergencies, critical alerts, time-sensitive patient care, urgent requests, any email with urgency keywords
- Normal: routine communications, general updates, non-critical information

IMPORTANT: If ANY urgency indicator is present in the email (subject OR body), classify as "Urgent". Err on the side of urgency for healthcare communications.

URGENCY INDICATORS: "emergency", "urgent", "critical", "immediate", "stat", "asap", "patient in distress", "code blue", "time sensitive", "deadline", "urgent response needed", "life threatening", "emergency room", "trauma", "cardiac arrest", "immediately", "as soon as possible", "right away", "without delay", "expires", "deadline", "due today", "must complete", "action required", "response needed"
```

### Email Generation Prompt
```
Generate a unique, realistic healthcare email that would be classified as "{randomType}".

Context: {randomHospital} - {randomDept} Department
Sender Role: {randomRole}
Recipient: {randomRecipient}
Urgency: {randomTime}
Generation #{generationCounter}
Unique ID: {randomId}
Timestamp: {timestamp}

Requirements:
- Make it completely unique and different from typical examples
- Include specific healthcare details, terminology, and context for {randomHospital}
- Use realistic sender domains and professional language
- Address the email appropriately to the recipient: {randomRecipient}
- For Safe: Normal hospital communications (schedules, reminders, announcements, policy updates, training notifications)
- For Suspicious: Unusual requests that might be legitimate but raise questions (access requests, data sharing, policy changes)
- For Phishing: Clear malicious intent targeting healthcare workers/patients (credential theft, fake alerts, urgent actions)

Be creative and avoid common patterns. Make each email feel like a real, unique communication.

Respond ONLY with this JSON format:
{
  "type": "{randomType}",
  "sender": "realistic.email@domain.com",
  "recipient": "{randomRecipient}",
  "subject": "Unique realistic subject line",
  "body": "Detailed unique email body content"
}

Make the email detailed, believable, and completely unique.
```

## Setup

1. **Get an OpenRouter API Key**:
   - Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   - Generate an API key (free tier available)

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your OpenRouter API key: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here`

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Demo**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - The API key will be loaded automatically from environment variables

## Usage
